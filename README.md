UART Communication with PIC Microcontroller (PIC16F877A)
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a widely used communication protocol in embedded systems, enabling serial communication between microcontrollers and other peripherals.this project demonstrate how to a led can we on and off using UART serial communication with microcontroller.
